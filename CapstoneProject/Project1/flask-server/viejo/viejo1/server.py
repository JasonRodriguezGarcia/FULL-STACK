# # to the database.db database file you created earlier by hand, and sets the 
# # row_factory attribute to sqlite3.Row so you can have name-based access 
# # to columns. This means that the database connection will return rows that
# # behave like regular Python dictionaries. Lastly, the function returns the 
# # conn connection object youâ€™ll be using to access the database.

#     # query result, this will return a list of the posts you inserted into
#     # the database in the previous step
